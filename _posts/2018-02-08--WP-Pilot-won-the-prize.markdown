I am very proud to announce that WP Pilot, the mobile app of which I am the architect, lead engineer and one of the programmers in [Wirtualna Polska](https://onas.wp.pl/), just won "The best B2C app of 2017" prize at the [Mobility Trends Gala](http://www.mobilitytrends.pl/).

The official Mobility Trends Gala website states:
>The prestigious Mobility Trends plebiscite, organized by MIT MEDIA Group, gives the opportunity to enter the new brands and products in the industry. The summary of 2017 in the new technologies industry will end with a gala ceremony, which will take place on February 1, 2018. Among the more than 450 guests there are people from the world of business, politics and show business. During the Mobility Trends Gala, the products / services that received the highest number of votes receive the "Golden Bell" award, a statuette created by the art studio Gama Art.

>The Mobility Trends Gala has become the prestigious and largest meeting of this industry in Poland. The winners from the 23 categories will received the "Golden Bell" awards, awarded in honor of Alexander Graham Bell - the inventor of the telephone.

>The winning solutions are determined by the consumers who cast their votes in the preferred solutions.

WP Pilot is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.videostar) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/wp-pilot-telewizja-online/id919545883). It's also available as a [Web Application](https://pilot.wp.pl/tv).

The WP Pilot is the app I have been working on for a long time, at first maintaining and developing it by myself as I took it over it from previous developer (as Videostar back then). Then change of the ownership of the service resulted in assigning a whole team to the development, of which I became the leader. Few months later, a business pivot made me decide to rewrite the app from scratch and I was responsible for creating the architecture and lead the technical way on both platforms. Now WP Pilot is 100% based on [Moviper](/moviper-the-android-viper-library) VIPER architecture library, both on Android and iOS. That allows us to maintain and develop the app easily without any bigger problems.

I am honored to receive this award -- enjoy the photos of the ceremony!.

**EDIT** On March, 2018 I got promoted to the Team Leader of whole WP Pilot team! That made me responsible also for backend and frontend of the WP Pilot service, in addition to Android and iOS mobile apps. Hooray! This is a huge challenge for me, I will do my best, I promise!
