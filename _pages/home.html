 <!-- how to rem-out liquid lines? they are parsed even if they are in html comment -->
 <!--  Why doesnt this foreach work? BECAUSE THERE IS PROBLEM WITH PAGINATION -> now i use site.posts instead of paginator.posts in include -->
 <!--  Probably there is a problem with pagination path in _config.yml-->
