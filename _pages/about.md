I'm Mateusz Ko≈õlacz and I love to work with people. I'm an enthusiast of a self-explaining, clean, comprehensible and decoupled architecture and code that provides long-term maintainable, bulletproof products that can share modules. This is my personal website where I publish my thoughts, observations and various curiosities.

Professionally I'm a Tech Lead of a "Las Motosierras" mobile development team in [Movibe](https://movibe.it/)/[Wirtualna Polska](https://onas.wp.pl/) (former Senior Android Developer).

I also attained a MEng degree in Computer Science at [Warsaw University of Technology Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng#) with the Information Systems Engineering specialization.
