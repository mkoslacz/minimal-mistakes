I'm Mateusz Ko≈õlacz and Senior Android Developer and a Tech Lead of a "Las Motosierras" mobile development team in [Movibe](https://movibe.it/) / [Wirtualna Polska](https://onas.wp.pl/). I'm also a co-founder of a [Faver](http://faverit.org/) startup. I'm a Master of Engineering in Computer Science graduated in [A+ rated](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/Aktualnosci/Nominacje-i-nagrody/Kategoria-naukowa-A-dla-Wydzialu-Elektroniki-i-Technik-Informacyjnych) [Warsaw University of Technology Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng#) in Information Systems Engineering specialisation. I'm an enthusiast of a self-explaining, clean, comprehensible and maintainable architecture and code that provides long-term maintainable, bulletproof products that can share modules. This is my personal website where I publish my thoughts, observations and various curiosities.
