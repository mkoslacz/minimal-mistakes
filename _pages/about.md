I'm Mateusz Ko≈õlacz and I'm an enthusiast of a self-explaining, clean, comprehensible and maintainable architecture and code that provides long-term maintainable, bulletproof products that can share modules. This is my personal website where I publish my thoughts, observations and various curiosities.

Professionally I'm a Tech Lead of a "Las Motosierras" mobile development team in [Movibe](https://movibe.it/) / [Wirtualna Polska](https://onas.wp.pl/) (former Senior Android Developer).

I'm also a Master of Engineering in Computer Science graduated in [Warsaw University of Technology Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology](http://www.elka.pw.edu.pl/eng#) in the Information Systems Engineering specialization.
